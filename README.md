# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Customer-Feedback
## Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback: Product and Service Improvements with Precision
Master Python and advanced language models to perform in-depth sentiment analysis of customer feedback. Using tools like Vader and NLTK, this project involves comprehensive analysis of customer reviews to extract sentiments and identify feedback trends. This experience enhances proficiency in natural language processing and provides deep insights into consumer perceptions.
## Business Overview/Problem
TechTrends E-commerce Solutions, although a thriving player in the e-commerce sector, faces the challenge of efficiently processing and deriving valuable insights from the substantial influx of customer feedback and reviews it receives on a daily basis. The company's overarching goal is to enhance customer satisfaction and continually refine its product and service offerings. To achieve this, TechTrends E-commerce Solutions seeks to address the following specific business problems:
A. Managing Feedback Overload: The company struggles with managing the sheer volume of customer feedback effectively. The influx of reviews from its extensive customer base is overwhelming and requires a streamlined approach to handle efficiently.
B. Improving Sentiment Classification: TechTrends aims to enhance the accuracy of sentiment classification for customer feedback. Currently, the categorization of feedback into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments is not as precise as desired. Improving this classification process is crucial for extracting more meaningful insights.
C. Resource Allocation Optimization: Manual analysis of customer feedback is resource-intensive and time-consuming. TechTrends E-commerce Solutions seeks to reduce these manual efforts through automation to allocate resources more effectively and efficiently.
## Rationale for the Project
- Sentiment analysis is a crucial tool in the field of natural language processing and data analytics. It involves the process of automatically determining the sentiment or emotional tone conveyed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
- Sentiment Analysis holds paramount importance in the business landscape. It enables a profound understanding of customer perceptions, driving buisness decisions. By decoding customer sentiment, businesses can swiftly address concerns, enhance satisfaction, and remain competitive. It also aids in identifying areas for improvement, managing brand reputation proactively, and streamlining operations. 
- Several Reasons accentuate the significance of sentiment analysis. It promotes customer satisfaction by resolving issues promptly and offers insights into competitors. Furthermore, it aids in product enhancement, safeguards brand reputation, and boosts operational efficiency through automation.
## Aim of the Project
- Our objectives can be summarized into two key areas. Firstly, we aim to develop a sentiment analysis model using NLP techniques, allowing us to effectively classify customer feedback into positive and negative categories. 
- Secondly, we focus on implementation and performance comparison of sentiment analysis tools like NLTK and VADER.
- In tandem, we aim to provide real-time sentiment analysis results to relevant teams, enabling prompt action. Simultaneously, we're committed to extracting actionable insights from sentiment data to drive improvements in customer service and product quality. Ultimately, our overarching objective is to proactively address customer concerns and feedback, thereby enhancing the overall customer experience
## Data Description
The e commerce company has collected over 3 million reviews. Our dataset is composed of 
•	A. Customer comments or reviews 
•	B. Sentiment labels (positive(label 2), negative(label 1)) for model training
 
We can utilize the customer comments or reviews as the input data and the sentiment labels (positive or negative) as the target variable to train a sentiment analysis model.
Tech Stack
## Programming language – Python
### Libraries to be used: 
•	A. NLTK: For natural language processing and sentiment analysis
•	B. VADER: For sentiment analysis
•	C. Pandas: For data analysis and manipulation
•	D. Scikit-learn: For machine learning
## Project Scope
A. Data Collection: Gather customer feedback from various platforms and sources
B. Data Preprocessing: Data Preprocessing is a vital preliminary step where we clean and refine raw text data. Techniques like tokenization and stop word removal ensure data readiness for sentiment analysis and model development.
C. Sentiment Analysis Model Development: We create sentiment analysis models using NLP with NLTK and VADER libraries. These models accurately classify customer feedback sentiments, yielding profound insights.
D. Model Comparison: Post-model development, we rigorously compare performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the most effective model for our application.

# Model Interpretation and Comparison
### VADER on Raw Text
- Accuracy: 71.67%
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score:
- Negative: Precision (0.87), Recall (0.51), F1-Score (0.64)
- Positive: Precision (0.65), Recall (0.92), F1-Score (0.76)
- Macro Avg: Precision (0.76), Recall (0.72), F1-Score (0.70)
- Weighted Avg: Precision (0.76), Recall (0.72), F1-Score (0.70)
VADER performed moderately well, with higher precision for negative sentiments but better recall for positive sentiments. The overall accuracy indicates that VADER can classify sentiments, but there's room for improvement, particularly in handling negative sentiments.

### VADER with Stopwords Removed
- Accuracy: 68.08%
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score:
- Negative: Precision (0.86), Recall (0.43), F1-Score (0.57)
- Positive: Precision (0.62), Recall (0.93), F1-Score (0.75)
- Macro Avg: Precision (0.74), Recall (0.68), F1-Score (0.66)
- Weighted Avg: Precision (0.74), Recall (0.68), F1-Score (0.66)
Removing stopwords slightly decreased the overall accuracy and F1-scores. The precision for negative sentiments remained high, but the recall dropped significantly, indicating that VADER struggled more to correctly identify negative reviews without stopwords.

### Bag of Words (BoW) Model
- Accuracy: 84.87%
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score:
- Negative: Precision (0.84), Recall (0.86), F1-Score (0.85)
- Positive: Precision (0.85), Recall (0.84), F1-Score (0.85)
- Macro Avg: Precision (0.85), Recall (0.85), F1-Score (0.85)
- Weighted Avg: Precision (0.85), Recall (0.85), F1-Score (0.85)
The BoW model significantly outperformed VADER, achieving higher accuracy and balanced precision and recall scores for both sentiment classes. This suggests that BoW, likely with a more sophisticated classifier, was better at capturing the nuances in the text data.

### TF-IDF Model
- Accuracy: 83.22%
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score:
- Negative: Precision (0.83), Recall (0.84), F1-Score (0.83)
- Positive: Precision (0.84), Recall (0.82), F1-Score (0.83)
- Macro Avg: Precision (0.83), Recall (0.83), F1-Score (0.83)
- Weighted Avg: Precision (0.83), Recall (0.83), F1-Score (0.83)
The TF-IDF model also performed well, with slightly lower accuracy than the BoW model but still much better than VADER. The balanced scores across all metrics indicate that TF-IDF is effective for this classification task.

### Business Implications
- Improved Customer Feedback Analysis: The higher accuracy of the BoW and TF-IDF models indicates more reliable sentiment analysis, enabling TechTrends to better understand customer opinions and preferences.
- Resource Allocation: Automated, accurate sentiment analysis reduces the need for manual review, saving time and resources.
- Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: By accurately identifying and addressing negative feedback, TechTrends can improve products and services, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Data-Driven Decisions: Reliable sentiment data supports strategic decisions, such as product development and marketing strategies, based on real customer feedback.
### Recommendations
- Deploy BoW or TF-IDF Models: Given their superior performance, these models should be preferred for operational use. Regular updates to the training data should be considered to maintain accuracy.
- Enhance Data Preprocessing: Further refine preprocessing steps, such as better handling of special characters and synonyms, to improve model performance.
- Combine Models: Consider an ensemble approach that combines the strengths of multiple models for even better accuracy.
- Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loop: Regularly monitor model performance and customer feedback to adjust and improve the sentiment analysis system.
- Scalability: Ensure the infrastructure can handle large volumes of data as the company grows and more feedback is collected.
